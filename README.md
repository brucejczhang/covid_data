# Predicting COVID-19 Risk in Canada Based on Region, Sex, and Age

## Overview

This repo provides students with a foundation for their own projects associated with *Telling Stories with Data*. You do not need every aspect for every paper and you should delete aspects that you do not need.

## Statement on Raw Data

The raw data used for this repo was too large to be added as part of the pacakge. The data was obtained from COVerAGE-DB from Open Science Framework (OSF) and can be downloaded at https://osf.io/43ucn. 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed and cleaned for the purpose of this analysis. 
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code for figure creation and testing were generated under the guidance of generative AI tool ChatGPT. The entire chat history is available in other/llms_usage/usage.txt.
